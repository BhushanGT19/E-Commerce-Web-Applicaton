# Introduction

Welcome to BookCharm, it aims to provide users with a seamless shopping experience, offering a wide range of products in Books categories.

The project is divided into two main services, each serving a distinct purpose:

## 1. Node.js Service

The Node.js service handles crucial functionalities such as authentication, authorization, and notification delivery. It ensures secure access to the Book Charm platform, manages user authentication sessions using JWT tokens, and facilitates email notifications using Nodemailer.

## 2. Spring Boot Service

The Spring Boot service serves as the backbone of the application, housing the core logic that drives the functionalities of Book Charm. It manages operations related to book listings, user orders, and overall business logic essential for the smooth functioning of the platform.

By dividing the project into these two services, Book Charm achieves modularity, scalability, and maintainability, allowing for efficient development and future enhancements.
